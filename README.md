# UdacityImageClassifier

This Python program was the capstone project for a Udacity Nanodegree in AI Programming with Python. It is a Computer Vision AI system which trains a neural network and then utilizes classification to identify flower type probabilities for new, unseen flower images fed into the system. 

(Need to point to flower image assets for training, validation, and testing)
